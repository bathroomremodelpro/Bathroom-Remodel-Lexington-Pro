  <ul>
    <li><strong>Increase Property Value:</strong> Modern fixtures and updated finishes are major selling points.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve Efficiency:</strong> New plumbing, lighting, and ventilation reduce energy and water waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhance Safety:</strong> A remodel can address hazards like slippery floors or poor lighting.</li>
    <li><strong>Reflect Your Style:</strong> Choose materials, colors, and layouts that suit your tastes.</li>
